# Astronomy Picture of the Day

## Introduction

For this project, you'll build an app to view the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html).

You will build the app primarily in Objective-C with some Swift components. The goal of this project is to practice using Swift and Objective-C together, including using features like nullability, lightweight generics, and name customization.

## Instructions

Fork and clone this repository. Create your own Xcode project. Commit regularly as you complete the requirements in this project.

The instructions for this project are intentionally sparse. At this point in the course, you are familiar with most of the concepts used in building an app like this, and should be able to implement it with minimal guidance. This also means that you have the freedom to implement most parts of the app as you see fit. However, please make sure you follow the instructions that are here.

## Implement the app using the Figma Design

1. Collection View with photos of the day (make all cells the same size to start).
2. Detail view with model popup
3. No Cocoapods

## Go Further

1. Make the collection view use different sized cells to feature today (similar to pinterest)
